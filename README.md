# food-for-health
App for finding places for SNAP, WIC, DUFB, and others

## What
This application is intended to serve as a resource for recipients of public benefits such as SNAP and WIC. The purpose is to allow users to locate sources of healthy food close to where they live or work, particularly in "food desert" areas where access to healthy food sources is limited. By using this application, users will be able to view a list or map of healthy food outlets, and then filter the displayed results if desired by selecting the types of food sources they seek, entering additional parameters such as whether the outlet accepts SNAP and/or WIC benefits, or whether the outlet provides additional benefits such as double benefits.
The ultimate objective is to support more healthy eating habits among recipients of public benefits as well as others choosing to utilize the system.
